# City
Find the best route possible based on a five-day in three-hour increments for five cities temperature forecast. It finds the 
highest temperature each day of the week for the five cities and uses permutation to determine which city to travel using the 
least hottest city, starting on Monday and finishing on Friday. The program also determines the average temperature for the five-days.
I used a json file from www.api.weathermap.org
